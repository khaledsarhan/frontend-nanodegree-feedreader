# Project Overview

In this project, we were given a premade RSS-Feed web app and were required to implement some testing for it. The goal of this project was to become familiar with Jasmine, and successfully write a test suite for the given app.

# Testing the application
To pass the test:

* All feeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
* Each feed should has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* Each feed should has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
* Ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
* Make sure the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
* Ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
* All the Jasmine App Tests you can see below the RSS feed item list.
